## The database API for [tilicev2](https://github.com/Flairwars/tilicev2)

### Setup
First step - I recommend setting up a virtual environment using `python -m venv .` in the root directory. 

Initialize the virtual environment using the appropriate file for your OS in `/Scripts` once it's generated

Then you can `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root folder to install the prerequisite files

Run the app from inside the `/src` directory using `python -m app`
